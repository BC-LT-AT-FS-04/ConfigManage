# Run the project

For the installation follow the steps described in [project configuration](https://github.com/BC-LT-AT-FS-04/ConfigManage/wiki/Local-configuration) to set the enviroment needed to run the project.  

Once you have configured your **Control node** (Ubuntu desktop) and **Managed node**(Ubuntu server Vm) you can run ansible with the following command.


* From your Ubuntu desktop machine make sure to be located in the directory with the playbook.yml file and run:

`$ ansible-playbook -i host_vars/inventory.yml playbook.yml`

**Note:** -i Refers to inventory file

 If you get an error requesting the server password add the -K flag and provide the ubuntu server password

`$ ansible-playbook -i host_vars/inventory.yml -K playbook.yml`
